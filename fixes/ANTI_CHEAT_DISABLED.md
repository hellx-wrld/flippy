# Anti-Cheat and Spam Protection Disabled

## Change Summary
Anti-cheat and spam protection systems have been disabled to allow unrestricted command usage.

## What Was Disabled

### 1. Anti-Cheat System
**File**: `src/utils/functions.js`
- **Function**: `checkAntiCheat()`
- **Original Behavior**: Tracked command usage and flagged suspicious activity
- **New Behavior**: Always returns `{ allowed: true, reason: null }`

### 2. Spam Protection
**Original Logic**:
- Tracked commands per user per minute
- Blocked users after 10+ commands per minute
- Showed message: "Command spam detected. Please wait before using commands again."

**New Logic**:
- No command rate limiting
- Users can send unlimited commands without restrictions

### 3. Message Event Anti-Cheat Check
**File**: `src/events/messageCreate.js`
- **Original**: Anti-cheat check was performed before executing commands
- **New**: Anti-cheat check is commented out and bypassed

## Code Changes

### functions.js
```javascript
// OLD:
const checkAntiCheat = async userId => {
    // Complex spam detection logic...
    if (user.commandCount > 10) {
        return { allowed: false, reason: 'Command spam detected...' };
    }
    return { allowed: true, reason: null };
};

// NEW:
const checkAntiCheat = async userId => {
    // Anti-cheat and spam protection disabled
    return { allowed: true, reason: null };
};
```

### messageCreate.js
```javascript
// OLD:
const antiCheatResult = await checkAntiCheat(message.author.id);
if (!antiCheatResult.allowed) {
    return message.channel.send(`❌ ${antiCheatResult.reason}`);
}

// NEW:
// Anti-cheat check for commands (DISABLED)
/* [commented out anti-cheat check] */
```

## Impact

### ✅ **Benefits**:
- **No Command Limits**: Users can use commands as fast as they want
- **No Cooldown Restrictions**: No more "please wait" messages
- **Faster Testing**: Developers can rapidly test commands
- **Better User Experience**: No interruptions for legitimate fast usage

### ⚠️ **Considerations**:
- **No Spam Protection**: Malicious users could potentially spam commands
- **No Rate Limiting**: Heavy command usage could impact bot performance
- **No Abuse Detection**: Suspicious activity won't be flagged

## Reverting Changes
To re-enable anti-cheat and spam protection:

1. **Uncomment the original `checkAntiCheat` logic** in `src/utils/functions.js`
2. **Uncomment the anti-cheat check** in `src/events/messageCreate.js`
3. **Restart the bot**

## Status
✅ **ACTIVE** - Anti-cheat and spam protection are disabled
